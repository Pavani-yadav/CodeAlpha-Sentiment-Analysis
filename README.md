# Sentiment Analysis on Population Data

## Project Overview
This project performs **sentiment analysis** on text data related to **population growth**, **decline**, and other population-related issues. The text is classified into **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** sentiments using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques, particularly using the **VADER SentimentIntensityAnalyzer**.

The results of the sentiment analysis are visualized and can be used to inform **marketing strategies**, **product development**, or **social insights**.

## Purpose
- **Sentiment Classification**: Analyzing sentiments in text data related to population, such as growth, migration, and decline.
- **Public Opinion Analysis**: Understanding public opinion about population-related topics.
- **Inform Marketing and Product Development**: Using sentiment trends to drive decisions in marketing strategies and product improvements.

## Features
- **Sentiment Classification**: Classifies sentiment as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** using **VADER SentimentIntensityAnalyzer**.
- **Data Visualizations**: Visualizes the sentiment distribution and population data using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
- **Insights**: Provides actionable insights on how sentiment can be used for **business decisions**, including **marketing**, **social strategy**, and **product development**.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for analysis and processing.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for running the code and visualizing results.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: Library used for text processing and sentiment analysis.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.

## Dataset
This project uses **sample text data** related to population discussions.
For the **World Bank Population Data**, you can replace the sample dataset with the official population dataset.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
git clone https://github.com/Pavani-yadav/CodeAlpha-Sentiment-Analysis.git`

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

#### On Windows:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### On macOS/Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Required Dependencies

Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not available, you can manually install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install nltk matplotlib seaborn pandas requests
```

### 4. Run the Jupyter Notebook

To run the Jupyter Notebook, execute the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook Sentiment_Analysis_Task4_Population.ipynb
```

## How to Use

1. **Replace Sample Data**: Replace the **sample text data** in the notebook with your own data (e.g., **Amazon reviews**, **social media comments**, or **news articles**).
2. **Run the Notebook**: Execute each cell in the notebook to perform **sentiment analysis** and visualize the results.
3. **Analyze Results**: The notebook will output sentiment classifications for each text entry and visualize the sentiment distribution.
4. **Actionable Insights**: Use the sentiment analysis results to inform decisions related to **marketing**, **product development**, or **public opinion analysis**.

## Files Included

* **Sentiment\_Analysis\_Task4\_Population.ipynb**: The main Jupyter notebook that contains the code for sentiment analysis, visualizations, and insights.
* **World Bank Population Data (optional)**: You can replace the sample dataset with the actual World Bank Population data or any other dataset relevant to the population.
* **requirements.txt**: A file that contains the dependencies needed for the project (if provided).
